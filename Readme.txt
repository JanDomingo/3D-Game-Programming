These are my games from SDSU CS583 3D Game Programming by Stephen Price

First game due was Tower Game which was built from a pre-made template.

Second game due was Astro Aegis under the folder CS583S19_2D_Game_Domingo_J_AstroAegis. This was built from scratch.

Third game due was Pregame Party under the folder CS583_3D_Game_Team02_PregameParty. This was built from scratch and was a group project. 

The details of Astro Aegis and Pregame Party can be found in a GDD document inside their respective folders. 

The folder Playable Executables contains the executable files for all 3 games so to access easily and play the game. Note that these games were built on a Mac and as a result, a Mac is needed to open the games.
